We have been created for, and called into community, by God, who is Himself community. Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Henri Nouwen once wrote, “God has made us into his people by calling us out of ‘Egypt’ to the ‘New Land,’ out of the desert to fertile ground, out of slavery to freedom, out of our sin to salvation, out of captivity to liberation. All these words and images give expression to the fact that the initiative belongs to God and that he is the source of our new life together.” And it’s with gratitude to God that we can give ourselves to others in community.

Isolation is living without light. No light, no life. The things that lead to death grow in the dark. For example, anxiety and depression grow in the dark. And in the dark, what grows doesn’t get better, it just gets bigger. Richard Baxter said, “In this dark, disordered condition, you're unfit to judge your own condition or the way to approach your duty.” Lies also get louder in isolation. Lies like we’re all alone. And because the Lord often uses others to communicate His love, when we live in isolation we lose our ability to believe that we are loved. That is right where the enemy of our souls wants us. But Jesus said, “the truth will set you free” (John 8:32). A relationship with God and others is not out of reach. Truth can be found in Christian community. That is good news! That is the Gospel!

Community is where others care for us, and where we care for others. In Christian community this is lived out with great purpose under the power of the Holy Spirit. It is the only way to live in obedience to God. “Carry each other's burdens and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ (Galatians 6:2). That’s why God baked the need to need, and the need to be needed into our DNA. When we start thinking that weakness is wrong, we are the ones who are actually wrong. In fact, Jesus said “My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness” (2 Corinthians 12:9). Together we can reject the rugged individualism that leads to reckless isolationism. And although we have been invited out of isolation, we must be intentional. Christian community must be calendared. So, I may not know you, but I know God, and with His help I know you can be responsible enough to reach out for relationship.
